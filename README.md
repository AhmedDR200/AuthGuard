# Express.js Authentication System

## Overview

This project is an authentication system built using Express.js. It provides a secure and scalable foundation for user authentication, including features like registration, login, password hashing, JWT-based authentication, and more.

## Features

- **User Registration**: New users can create an account by providing necessary details like username, email, and password.
- **User Login**: Registered users can log in using their email and password.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure the API with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected routes.
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
- **Protected Routes**: Implement route protection to restrict access to authenticated users only.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Token for secure, stateless authentication.
- **bcrypt**: Library to hash and compare passwords securely.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store user data securely.
- **Mongoose**: Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
